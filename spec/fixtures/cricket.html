  <b>2.30pm</b> A little fist-bump between Rohit Sharma and Shikhar Dhawan just before they step over the boundary line. It's Rohit to take strike, and Dale Steyn to bowl the first over. He's got gelled, slicked-back hair. I'm not sure I like the look.
  </p>
  <p>
  <b>2.25pm</b> Loads of blue in the crowd, a few scattered bits of green too, but I also see plenty of empty seats. I suppose they'll fill up soon.
  </p>
  <p>
  Simon : "I think it's a smart move to bring Parnell into the side. At MCG the quick bouncy wicket will make Parnell difficult to play. Go Saffers."
  </p>
  <p>
  <b>2.10pm</b> Meanwhile, Sri Lanka are 51 for 4 <a href="http://www.espncricinfo.com/icc-cricket-world-cup-2015/engine/match/656421.html" target="_blank">in Dunedin</a>, chasing 233 against Afghanistan. Hamid Hassan has just picked up his 50th ODI wicket.
  </p>
  <p>
  Prasad: "Braved the Blizzard here in Denver, CO, USA and drove miles to watch the game at a friend's place. Hope India wins the match."
  </p>
  <p>
  <b>2.00pm</b> Toss time. MS Dhoni calls heads, it's heads, and <b>India are batting first</b>. They're going with the same eleven that played against Pakistan. One change for South Africa. <b>Wayne Parnell is in for Farhaan Behardien</b>. That's a potentially short batting line-up, should India manage to make early inroads.

  <b>1.55pm</b> The pitch for the Boxing Day Test here was a perfect batting track. This one's a little different. There's an even covering of grass, and it's green grass. It's quite hard as well, say Sourav Ganguly and Pommie Mbangwa. This, they agree, is not a 300 pitch. Shane Warne says it could zip through even more under lights, so win the toss and bat first, but Shaun Pollock reckons both teams might want to use the freshness early on.
  </p>
  <p>
  Paritosh Anand: "My prediction: India loses top order. Middle order saves the day. SA top order fires but their wickets fall in heap. India pull off a narrow win. You heard it here first"
  </p>
  <p>
  Isaac: "Quinton de Kock century. You heard it here first!"
  </p>
  <p>
  Ahmed Irfan: "Last time when South Africa played against Australia in Melbourne, Australia had never beaten them at the venue but that was broken at the end of the day. This time India enter into the match in a similar scenario. Is it India's Day then?"
  </p>
  <p>
  <b>1.30pm</b> Mark Nicholas just had a chat with Ravi Shastri out in the middle, and here are some of the things India's team director had to say: "This side is not intimidated by anyone. They know their job. They take it one opposition at a time. Yes, concerned about the consistency of the bowling attack. That's the endeavor, to repeat the performance against Pakistan and make it a habit. No tactics for [death bowling]. If you plan it too far ahead, you are going to mess it up. Clarity of thought is the most important
  thing. South Africa is a good all-round side. On paper, they don't give an inch, and we don't given an inch either. This is one of the great pieces of turf in the world. I told
  the guys to go out and enjoy themselves. Two weeks from now will be the right
  time to peak."

  <b>1.15pm</b> Afternoon, everyone. Huge game today at the MCG. India have never beaten South Africa in a World Cup, and they'll need to put in a massive performance today to buck that trend. Both teams have opened their campaigns with wins, and while the result of this clash shouldn't have too much bearing on either team reaching the knockouts, it will tell us quite a bit about where they stand and their prospects for the rest of the tournament.
  </p>
  <p>
  A couple of things for you to read while we build up towards the toss. First, <a href="http://www.espncricinfo.com/icc-cricket-world-cup-2015/content/story/835865.html" target="_blank">the preview</a>. Then there's the prolific Firdose Moonda, who walks you around <a href="http://www.espncricinfo.com/icc-cricket-world-cup-2015/content/story/836049.html" target="_blank">the MCG and its surrounds</a>, and also reflects on <a href="http://www.espncricinfo.com/icc-cricket-world-cup-2015/content/story/836003.html" target="_blank">the friendships</a> formed between the Indian and South African players through playing with and against each other in the IPL. Michael Hussey, who's working with the South Africa side as a consultant during this tournament, is impressed with the atmosphere of the team and its "<a href="http://www.espncricinfo.com/icc-cricket-world-cup-2015/content/story/836019.html" target="_blank">family feel</a>".

      Oh, my. That's an unfortunate way to go. Dhawan comes on the front foot to push into the covers, where Duminy makes a super diving stop, and the ball rolls to AB at mid-off. Rohit had sprinted out of his crease, and was quite a distance down it when he realised the ball hadn't gone past the fielder. Stumbled as he turned. AB hits the stumps direct, and Rohit is well short, even while diving, and the bat's slipped out of his hand as well.   </p>

  PG: "The wickets falling in a clutch might remind people of the 2011 game, but there is a marked difference - in 2011, India were looking set for a 350+ score, but could only score 297.

  James B: "307 is a cracking score and will take some chasing bit you have got to wonder whether the 4 for 41 of the last six overs will come back to haunt them. They really should have got 320-plus from 3 for 266. Very poor finish. Did something similar against Pakistan but got away against a much weaker batting line-up. Will be interesting to see how their popgun attack manages the much vaunted SAF line up."

  Ajinkya Rahane says it's a decent total to defend, with the big outfield, "if we bowl well. First ten overs will be crucial." 
  </p>
  <p class="commsText">
  <b>6.27pm</b> Wonderful batting from Dhawan and Rahane, and a good contribution from Kohli as well, to set India up. They lost a clump of wickets towards the end, and maybe didn't get as many as they could have, but 307 is still a very good score. South Africa have an excellent batting line-up, of course, so this should be a great chase to watch. South Africa innings will begin at 6.57 local time - in half an hour's time.
